# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a set of header files which can help Vex coding in Houdini.

## Requirements
Valid placement of the header file if desired to be used. The header file must be placed in Houdini<ver> > vex > include folder.

### Import Requirements
No other modules are required, and the header must be imported in prior to usage. Double import is not a probelm (guard is included in the header file). The documentation does not appear in the Houdini coding window, so for documentation, refer to the code directly.

## Side notes
 * Some functions require its helper functions to preprocess. Please becareful when using for technical purposes.
